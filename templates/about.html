It uses open source technologies including the Python <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django web framework</a>, <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a> search server and <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> database server.
</p>
<p>
The user interface was designed by the <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/omc/">UQ Office of Marketing and Communications</a>.
